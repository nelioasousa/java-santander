# Description
DIO Lab: Simulando Uma Conta Bancária Através Do Terminal/Console.

Just a printing exercise with a bank account context.

To learn more, I got into reading about `java.util.Scanner` and other methods of obtaining user input. The Java SE 8 documentation is quite straightforward about `Scanner`, but it becomes confusing in the "Number syntax" section since it discusses regex, which is quite a complex subject.
